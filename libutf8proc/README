libutf8proc
===========

This is the Public software group utf8proc library [1] repackaged as a
conveniance library for NetSurf. Previously this library was simply
copied into the NetSurf sources.

This takes the unicode 11 capable version 2.2.0 of the library and
converts it to the NetSurf build system which adds the generation of a
pkg-config file. There are no code changes from upstream.

All the Makefiles and changes are licenced as per the utf8proc
source using the MIT "expat" licence.
