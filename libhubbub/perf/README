This directory contains some very basic cobbled-together performance tests.
A makefile is provided for generating the executables from the .c files.


html5libtest.py
---------------

  This tests the Python html5lib project, obtained from:
  	http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/

  This is generally quite a slow parser.  :)


libxml2.c
---------

  This tests the GNOME libxml2 HTML parser, using mmap().  It doesn't do
  anything with the resulting tree, just generates one.


hubbub.c
--------

  This tests hubbub, using mmap(), and a modified version of the test 
  treebuilder.  It could certainly be made more efficient (it's based on
  an old version of the tree construction testrunner) so should not be
  compared too harshly against the libxml2 results.
