NetSurf Project
===============

The NetSurf project is developing a document browser for the World
Wide Web. It was started in 2002 on the RISC OS platform and has
support for numerous operating systems and graphical toolkits.

NetSurf is very modular and built from many component libraries which
provide functionality from GIF image format decoding (libnsgif) to
HTML document object model handling (libdom).

NetSurf browser is open source and is licensed under the GPLv2 (with
OpenSSL exception). Many of the supporting libraries are under a MIT
licence.
