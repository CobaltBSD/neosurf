LibXML binding for libdom
=========================

  This is a wrapper around libxml's push parser API, to facilitate
  construction of a libdom DOM tree. The basic premise is that the wrapper
  intercepts the SAX events emitted by libxml's tokeniser then invokes 
  libxml's own SAX handlers, wrapping the results up in libdom-specific
  data structures.

  The tree created is thus a tree of libdom nodes, each of which is linked
  to the libxml node that backs it. This allows the binding to process the
  DOM tree using libxml api, should it need to (e.g. for normalization
  purposes).
