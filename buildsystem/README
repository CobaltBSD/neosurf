NetSurf shared build system
===========================

To install
----------

   make install [PREFIX=/somewhere]

By default, PREFIX will be /opt/netsurf and this will be true for all
makefiles which use the shared build infrastructure.

To use
------

See the example in example/

Note that PREFIX must be the same for when you compile/test/install
anything using this build system as it was when you installed it in
the first place.

If it is not (or if packaging is getting in the way or similar) then
simply set NSSHARED to the path to the shared build system (up to an
including simply pointing at the directory containing this README) and
the makefiles will work the rest out.
