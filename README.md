# NeoSurf

This project is a fork of Netsurf with various improvements and additions, and a revamped build system.

## Why?
NeoSurf has a different development vision from NetSurf.

![GNU.org](img/scr2.png?raw=true "GNU.org")

## Development
Current focus is on general improvements to the codebase, as well as fixing a number of issues and bugs that were present in the most recent versions of NetSurf.

## Biggest differences from NetSurf
* [Visurf support](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/visurf/), with various upstream improvements and fixes
* Various upstream improvements and UI enhancements to Gtk frontend
* Removed compatibility for super old and/or obscure libraries/software/operating systems
* Dedicated LibreSSL support
* Various privacy improvements
* Rewritten build system
* Simplified frontend development

## Known Issues
At the moment preferences on Gtk frontend do not take effect, and as such this menu is currently disabled. This issue is inherited from NetSurf and will be amended soon.

## Building and installation
In the root of the source tree:
```sh
$ mkdir -v build
$ cd build
```

To build with both Visurf and Gtk frontends:
```sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
```
To build with Visurf only:
```sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DNEOSURF_BUILD_GTK_FRONTEND=OFF
```
To build with Gtk only:
```sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DNEOSURF_BUILD_VI_FRONTEND=OFF
```
To build libneosurf only (no frontend):
```sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DNEOSURF_BUILD_GTK_FRONTEND=OFF -DNEOSURF_BUILD_VI_FRONTEND=OFF
```

Then:
```sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

At build-time, NeoSurf requires Python3, CMake, GNU make (or another CMake-compatible build utility), and a POSIX-compliant shell.

At runtime and build-time, the following libraries and their development headers are required:
* libjpeg-turbo (or mozjpeg)
* libpng
* libcurl
* OpenSSL or LibreSSL (libcrypto, libssl)
* libwebp
* libpsl
* gperf
* libxml2
* flex
* bison or byacc
* pkg-config or pkgconf
* cairo (Visurf and Gtk only)
* pango (Visurf and Gtk only)
* wayland (Visurf only)
* xkbcommon (Visurf only)
* gtk+ (Gtk only)

However you obtain these utilities and libraries depends on your distribution.
