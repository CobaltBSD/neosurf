Libnslog - NetSurf Logging Library
==================================

Overview
--------

  Libnslog provides a category-based logging library which supports complex
  logging filters, multiple log levels, and provides context through to client
  applications.

Requirements
------------

  Libnslog requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Pkg-config
    + Check (test framework only)
    + Flex
    + Bison

Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the library is working, it is necessary to specify a
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:

  		$ make test

API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
