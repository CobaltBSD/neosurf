User Interface
==============

[TOC]

Netsurf is divided into a series of frontends which provide a user
interface around common core functionality. Each frontend is a
distinct implementation for a specific GUI toolkit.

Because of this the user interface has different features in
each frontend allowing the browser to be a native application.

# Frontends

## gtk

Frontend that uses the GTK+3 toolkit

## visurf

Frontend that uses the Vi bindings on Wayland

# User configuration

The behaviour of the browser can be changed from the defaults with a
configuration file. The [core user options](docs/netsurf-options.md)
of the browser are common to all versions and are augmented by each
frontend in a specific manner.
