Libnsfb - NetSurf Framebuffer Library
=====================================

Overview
--------

  Libnsfb is a framebuffer drawing library with a simple interface,
  providing a consistent API across a number of framebuffer implementations.

Requirements
------------

  Libnsfb requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Pkg-config

  The following libraries may also be installed:

    +  SDL 1.2 (for the SDL surface)
    +  libxcb* (for the X11 surface)
    *  wayland-client (for wayland surface)
    *  libvncserver (for vnc surface)

Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the parser is working, it is necessary to specify a 
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:
  
  		$ make test

API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the 
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources 
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
