/** \file
 * The image content handler intermediate image cache.
 *
 * This cache allows netsurf to use a generic intermediate bitmap
 * format without keeping the
 * intermediate representation in memory.
 *
 * The bitmap structure is opaque to the rest of netsurf and is
 * controlled by the platform-specific code (see image/bitmap.h for
 * detials). All image content handlers convert into this format and
 * pass it to the plot functions for display,
 * 
 * This cache maintains a link between the underlying original content
 * and the intermediate representation. It is intended to be flexable
 * and either manage the bitmap plotting completely or give the image
 * content handler complete control.
